# Marketing Strategy Analysis

## Statistical Significance Analysis
The confidence interval of ($1.23, $1.60) for the difference in mean sales (μ_new - μ_old) provides strong evidence of statistical significance. This interval does not contain zero, which indicates that the difference between the new and old marketing strategies is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. In other words, we can be 95% confident that the true difference in mean sales between the new and old marketing strategies lies between $1.23 and $1.60 per day.

The statistical significance is clear because:
- The entire confidence interval lies above zero
- Both the lower bound ($1.23) and upper bound ($1.60) are positive
- This indicates a consistent positive effect of the new marketing strategy on sales

## Practical Significance Analysis
Despite being statistically significant, the new marketing strategy lacks practical significance when considering its implementation cost. The strategy would cost $5.00 per day to implement, while the maximum expected benefit (using the upper bound of the confidence interval) is only $1.60 per day in increased sales.

The financial implications are:
- Best case scenario (using upper bound): $1.60 increase - $5.00 cost = -$3.40 per day
- Worst case scenario (using lower bound): $1.23 increase - $5.00 cost = -$3.77 per day

## Conclusion
This case clearly illustrates the important distinction between statistical and practical significance. While we have strong statistical evidence that the new marketing strategy increases sales (statistical significance), the magnitude of this increase is not large enough to justify the implementation costs (lack of practical significance). The strategy would result in a net loss of at least $3.40 per day even under the most optimistic scenario.

This analysis demonstrates why business decisions should consider both statistical and practical significance, with particular attention to cost-benefit analysis when evaluating new initiatives.
