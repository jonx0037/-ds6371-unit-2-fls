Polished PowerPoint Slide Outline for FLS Unit 2 Assignment

Below is a draft outline of my PowerPoint presentation. It includes slide titles, content ideas, and suggested visual elements to make my presentation polished and impactful.

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Creativity Analysis: Comparing Intrinsic and Extrinsic Treatments
Subtitle: A Statistical Exploration of Motivation and Creativity
Visuals:
	•	A modern background with creativity-themed imagery (e.g., lightbulb or abstract design).
	•	My name, date, and course information.

Slide 2: Objectives

Title: Objectives of the Analysis
Content:
	•	Summarize the purpose of the analysis.
	•	Objectives:
	•	Explore the effect of intrinsic vs. extrinsic treatments on creativity scores.
	•	Perform statistical tests to determine significance.
	•	Provide actionable insights based on findings.
Visuals:
	•	Use a SmartArt diagram to show objectives.

Slide 3: Methodology

Title: Methodology
Content:
	•	Data source: 47 creativity scores, categorized by treatment type (intrinsic/extrinsic).
	•	Statistical methods: Descriptive statistics, boxplot visualization, and t-test.
	•	Software: R and Plotly for analysis and visualization.
Visuals:
	•	A flowchart or timeline summarizing steps in the methodology.

Slide 4: Descriptive Statistics

Title: Summary Statistics
Content:
	•	Table showing each group's mean, median, standard deviation, and range.
	•	Key insights: Differences in means and variability.
Visuals:
	•	A neatly formatted table.
	•	A side-by-side bar chart comparing group means and variability.

Slide 5: Data Visualization

Title: Data Visualization
Content:
	•	Description of the boxplot:
	•	Distribution of scores for intrinsic and extrinsic groups.
	•	Overlay of individual data points (jittered) and mean values.
	•	Key findings highlighted in annotations.
Visuals:
	•	Static boxplot image with annotations.
	•	A hyperlink to the interactive Plotly visualization.

Slide 6: T-Test Results

Title: Two-Sample T-Test Results
Content:
	•	Hypotheses:
	•	Null: No difference in creativity scores between treatments.
	•	Alternative: A difference exists.
	•	p-value and interpretation:
	•	p-value < 0.05 → reject the null hypothesis.
	•	Confidence interval for mean difference.
Visuals:
	•	A callout box summarizing the p-value and confidence interval.
	•	A simple decision tree diagram to explain the conclusion.

Slide 7: Insights and Implications

Title: Key Insights and Practical Implications
Content:
	•	Insights:
	•	Extrinsic treatment shows higher mean creativity but also higher variability.
	•	Implications:
	•	Use intrinsic motivation for consistent creativity.
	•	Consider external costs or practicality when using extrinsic motivators.
Visuals:
	•	Icon-based bullet points.
	•	A cost-benefit analysis chart.

Slide 8: Practical and Statistical Significance

Title: Practical vs. Statistical Significance
Content:
	•	Statistical significance: p-value and confidence interval interpretation.
	•	Practical significance:
	•	Application in real-world settings.
	•	Potential constraints (e.g., cost of implementing extrinsic treatments).
Visuals:
	•	Comparison table of statistical vs. practical significance.

Slide 9: Conclusion

Title: Conclusion and Next Steps
Content:
	•	Summary of findings:
	•	Treatment type influences creativity scores.
	•	Statistical evidence supports the differences.
	•	Future research:
	•	Investigate underlying mechanisms of motivation.
	•	Explore broader applications of findings.
Visuals:
	•	A summary infographic or key takeaways list.

Slide 10: Interactive Demo and Q&A

Title: Interactive Demo and Q&A
Content:
	•	Link to the interactive visualization for exploration.
	•	Open floor for audience questions.
Visuals:
	•	Screenshot or preview of the interactive Plotly plot.
	•	Link to the HTML file.

Additional Notes
	•	Formatting: Use consistent fonts (e.g., Roboto) and a cohesive color palette.
	•	Transitions: Subtle transitions to maintain a professional flow.
	•	Hyperlinks: Ensure all links to external content (e.g., Plotly visualization) are functional.
	•	Backup Materials: Include extra slides at the end with detailed tables or complete RMarkdown code for reference.
