# Testing a New Marketing Strategy's Impact on Sales
## Statistical Significance:

- A 95% confidence interval of ($1.23, $1.60) for (μ_new - μ_old) means we're 95% confident that the actual difference in mean sales between the new and old marketing strategies falls within this range
- Since this interval does not contain 0 (both bounds are positive), the result is statistically significant
- In other words, we have strong evidence that the new marketing strategy is genuinely increasing sales, and this increase is not just due to random chance


## Practical Significance:

- The new strategy costs $5.00 per day to implement
- Even at the higher end of our confidence interval ($1.60 increase in mean sales), the cost ($5.00) exceeds the increase in sales
- At the lower end ($1.23 increase), the situation is even worse
- Therefore, while the sales increase is statistically significant, it is not practically substantial because implementing the strategy would result in a net loss:

> Best case: $1.60 increase - $5.00 cost = -$3.40 per day
> Worst case: $1.23 increase - $5.00 cost = -$3.77 per day

## Conclusion:

While we can be confident that the new marketing strategy does increase sales (statistical significance), the increase is not significant enough to justify the implementation cost (lack of practical importance). The company would lose money by implementing this strategy despite its proven ability to increase sales.

This example illustrates a key principle in statistical analysis: statistical significance does not always equate to practical significance. For sound decision-making, businesses should consider both types of significance.
